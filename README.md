# Project For Text Encryption

## What does this project do?
```text 
The expectation of this project is to receive a file, encrypt its content and return it in the same format, but fully encrypted and through a file, it will be possible to decrypt it.
```

## What was used in it?
- Node
- Typescript

## Procedure for use
1. Make a clone [of this repository](https://github.com/jaoguimaraes/project-for-text-encryption.git): 
```text
    https://github.com/jaoguimaraes/project-for-text-encryption.git
```
2. Install node: npm `init -y`
3. Install the `npm i` dependencies
4. Insert the data you want to encrypt, in the `teste.txt` file located in the root of the project.

## How to run?
`npm run dev`. But under the hood it is running: `npx tsc` and then `node src/index.js` 

## Improvements in mind
- At least 3 encryption options
- encrypt and decrypt special characters
- Encryption making it possible to read any type of file.
- Develop a simple frontend in Flutter to link to this project.
